# Memory allocation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation

1. Static memory allocation
2. Automatic memory allocation
3. Dynamic memory allocation

# Static memory allocation

Static-duration variables are allocated in main memory, usually along with the executable code of the program, and persist for the lifetime of the program.
* Faster execution than dynamic.

# Automatic memory allocation

Automatic-duration variables are allocated on the stack and come and go as functions are called and return.

# Dynamic memory allocation

Memory is more explicitly (but more flexibly) managed, typically by allocating it from the free store (informally called the "heap").

# code
* Dynamic memory allocation for an integer variable
* Dynamic memory allocation for an array
* Static memory allocation for an array
